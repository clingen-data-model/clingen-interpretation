Scope and Usage
---------------

Interpretations of Variant Pathogenicity are most effective when they are constructed according to published community guidelines. These guidelines, or AssertionMethods explicitly state individual criteria for pathogenicity, and describe how individual criteria are reconciled or combined to produce a final interpretation.  One such assertion method is the ACMG Variant Pathogeniciy Guideline.
