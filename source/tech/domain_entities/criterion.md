Scope and Usage
---------------

In the ACMG Variant Pathogenicity guideline, data is assessed by the application of a prescribed set of criteria.  These criteria describe standard arguments that can be made about the pathogenicity of a variant.

For instance, a variant with a common frequency in a population is unlikely to be causal for a serious rare condition.  This inference is captured in a Criterion.  In the ACMG framework, this particular criterion has the identifier BA1.  In this version of the model, instances of Criteria correspond exactly to the criteria of the ACMG Variant Pathogenicity guideline.
