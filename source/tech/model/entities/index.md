Overview
--------

Interpretations are modeled as entities generated by a series of activities carried out by agents, expressed using the W3c-Prov model for provenance.  In W3C-Prov, an entity represents either something that was generated by an activity (such as an interpretation), or something that an activity used as input, such as particular piece of data.  The same entity may be the output of one activity, and the input to another activity.  The relationships between entities and activites are shown in the table below:

TODO: STYLE TABLES

|Entity|GeneratedBy|UsedBy|
|:-----|:----------|:-----|
|PublicationStatus|PublishVariantInterpretation||
|VariantInterpretation|GenerateVariantInterpretation|PublishVariantInterpretation|
|CriterionAssessment|AssessCriterion|GenerateVariantInterpretation|
|EvidenceData|CaptureEvidenceData|AssessCriterion|
|EvidenceDataSource||CaptureEvidenceData|


Note that PublicationStatus is not used by any activities in the current model, and that EvidenceDataSource is not generated by any activities; these represent the end and beginning of the provenance chain.   Implementations or users of this data may choose to extend the provenance chain, tracking the use of PublicationStatus or recording the provenance of EvidenceDataSources.
