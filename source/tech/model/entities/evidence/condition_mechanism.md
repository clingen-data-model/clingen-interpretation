Scope and Usage
---------------

Some conditions are differentially driven by particular class of alleles, such as nonsense variants within a given gene.  ConditionMechanism represents such statements.  The particular class of alleles that cause disease is listed in the mechanism attribute, and the strength of the association may be one of four values: 

1) primary: alleles of the given class account for most cases
2) common: alleles of the given class account for many, but not all, cases
3) established: some alleles of the class cause the condition
4) suggested: it is unknown whether any alleles of the class cause the condition, though there is some evidence to suggest that they do.
