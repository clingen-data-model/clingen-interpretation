Scope and Usage
---------------

Previous incidence of a condition in a family provides important clues as to the mechanism.  For instance, if a family has multiple instances of a condition, then a DeNovo allele is an unlikely mechanism.  This data element associates a family with a condition and states whether one or more family members, other than the proband, have the condition.
