Scope and Usage
---------------

Computational tools can make predictions about the effect of a sequence allele on the normal function and splicing of a gene product.  The InSilicoPrediction element represents these predictions.  ContextualAlleles are used because a ContextualAllele represents an allele within a given sequence, e.g. a particular transcript, since in order to make predictions, these tools require a specific transcript to be specified.
