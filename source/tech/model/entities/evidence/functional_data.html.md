Scope and Usage
---------------

FunctionalData comprises any experimental measurement of the function of a gene, usually (but not always) in relation to the presence of an allele.   Many classes of in vivo and in vitro experimental data may be included.  Rather than attempt a full classification of the types of functional data and models for each, this model provides a single type of functional data with several optional elements to tag relevant entities such as genes or alleles.
