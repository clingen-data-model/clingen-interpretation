Hereditary conditions are passed through generations with different modes of inheritance.  Examples include autosomal dominant or recessive, and various forms of sex-linked inheritance.

The ConditionInheritance element makes an unambiguous statement about the inheritance mode of a condition.    This is only possible if the condition has an unambiguous mode of inheritance, either because it is monogenic, or if the inheritance mode is part of the definition of the condition.  If, however, the condition has multiple inheritance modes, it is possible to specify a gene or allele that narrows down the condition to a single mode of inheritance.
