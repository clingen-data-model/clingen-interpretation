Scope and Usage
---------------

The AlleleFrequency data element captures data related to a measurement of a particular allele's frequency in a given set of people.   It can be used to represent population data, such as that found in ExAC, or it can be used to represent ad hoc groups such as a case or control group.

The attributes of AlleleFrequency provide information on the population background of the group and the purpose for which the group was ascertained, as well as details of the frequency to allow users to understand the quality of the frequency estimate.
