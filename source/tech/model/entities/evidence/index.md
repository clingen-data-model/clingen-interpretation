Scope and Usage
---------------

Interpretations are created by reasoning over Data.  Individual atomic pieces of evidence are represented by Data elements.   Data has numerous subclasses, tailored to represent the types of evidence used in the evaluation of ACMG Variant Pathogenicity Guidelines; expansion of the interpretation model into other arenas will also expand the set of available Data types.

The Data entity itself provides no attributes besides those inherited from Entity.   Instances of Data should be instances of a subclass providing data-specific attributes.

Data entities are generated by CaptureData activities, and are used by AssessCriteria activities.
