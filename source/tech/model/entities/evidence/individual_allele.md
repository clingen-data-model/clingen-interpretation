Scope and Usage
---------------

The IndividualAllele entity represents information about one or two alleles and an individual.  Alleles, whether listed as primary or secondary are asserted to be alleles that the individual has.   The phase indicates the phase between the two alleles, and as such is only used if the two alleles are both heterozygous, and on the same chromosome.  This structure can not be used to represent the statement that an individual has no copies of an allele.
