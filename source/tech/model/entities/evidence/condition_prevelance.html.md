Scope and Usage
---------------

ConditionPrevalence encodes the rate at which a condition occurs within a population.  Especially for rare diseases, measurement of prevalence may be difficult, and it may be expressed as an inequality (e.g. less than 1 in 100000).  For this reason, prevalence may be expressed as a simple value, an upper or lower bound, or a combination of the above.
