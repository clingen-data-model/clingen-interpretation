Scope and Usage
---------------

If a gene, or a region within a gene, has a low rate of benign missense alleles, then missense alleles in that gene or region are less likely to be benign.  This Data represents the rate at which benign missense alleles occur.

The unit over which the benign missense rate is defined may either be an entire Gene, or a portion of a gene as defined by a ContextualRegion.
