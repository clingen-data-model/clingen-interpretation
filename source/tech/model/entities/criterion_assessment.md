Scope and Usage
---------------

A CriterionAssessment represents the result of applying a named Criterion to a set of EvidenceData.   In the context of ACMG Variant Pathogenicity interpretations, a Criterion is a particular rule, such as PM1, and the CriterionAssessment is the statement, for example, that this set of evidence provides moderate support that the variant is pathogenic, or that the evidence is inconsistent with pathogenicity.  A CriterionAssessment represents not a single piece of evidence, but the combination of a line of evidence and a particular reasoning statement (the Criterion).
