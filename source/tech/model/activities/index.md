Overview
--------

Interpretations are modeled as _entities_ generated by a series of _activities_ carried out by _agents_.  These concepts and their relationships are expressed using the W3C-Prov model for provenance. The interpretation model codifies four separate activities, corresponding to stages of the variant interpretation process:
    1. CaptureEvidenceData: The activity of gathering a particular piece of data and adding it to the interpretation.
    2. AssessCriteria: The activity of combining a group of evidence with a particular reasoning criteria, and deciding how strongly the evidence supports the particular criteria.
    3. GenerateVariantInterpretation: The activity of combining one or more (CriteriaAssessments)[] to create an interpretation.
    4. PublishVariantInterpretation: The activity of signing off an interpretation to create a publication statement (WERE NOT DONE HERE.)

Each of these activities represents some time-bounded action that (usually) takes some entities as inputs and creates a new entity as an output:

Each Activity is represented by a purple box, with its used entities above it, and the entity that it generates below it.
