Scope and Usage
---------------

The primary types in interpretations are Entities, Agents, and Activities.  In particular, Entities are used to define both the inputs and outputs of interpretations, including the Data used in interpretations.   Modeling this data, however, sometimes requires helper types to structure information.  Those types, which support Data types, but are not themselves descended from PROV Entity, are described here.
