Scope and Usage
---------------

DeNovo alleles are those alleles in an individual that were not transmitted to them from either of their parents.   Deciding that an allele is DeNovo in an individual requires checking for the presence of the allele in the parents.   A greater degree of confidence can be achieved by genetic confirmation of the putative parentage.
