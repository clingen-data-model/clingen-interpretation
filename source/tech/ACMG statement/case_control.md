Scope and Usage
---------------

CaseControl represents data relating the frequency of a given CanonicalAllele to the case-control status for a given Condition.   The frequencies of the allele in these groups is represented by GroupAlleleFrequency elements.   Because PopulationAlleleFrequency descends from GroupAlleleFrequency, it may also be used, usually for the control group frequency.

Results of case control statistical analysis are presented as an odds ratio with a confidence level indicating the degree of confidence that the odds ratio is between the given upper and lower bounds.
