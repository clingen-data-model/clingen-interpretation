Scope and Usage
---------------

AlleleConservation represents the degree to which an allele is the same (conserved) across different species.   If an allele is the same in many species, it often represents an important functional portion of a gene; variations in the allele may therefore tend to be more pathogenic.

Most conservation calculations are given on a computational score based on a set of multiple sequence alignments across species. To properly describe a conservation data element, it is important to include both the method used and the score that the method provided.
