Scope and Usage
---------------

For many pathogenic variants, not everybody with the variant will be affected with the associated condition.  This is expressed in the quantity penetrance, which is defined as the ratio of the number of people with the disease and the variant to the total number of people with the variant.

While penetrance has a precise mathematical definition, it is not often expressed numerically, largely because available data rarely allows good estimates for these quantities.   Furthermore, diseases with age-dependent onsets make data collection difficult, since an unaffected person may simply not yet have reached the age at which they will be affected.  For these reasons, penetrance is usually described qualitatively, a tack that is followed here.
