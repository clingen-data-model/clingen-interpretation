Scope and Usage
---------------

Records the degree to which a condition is specific to a particular gene.   Each ConditionEtiology relates one condition to one gene.   If knowledge of the condition alone is enough to say that the gene must be involved, then the specificity is high.  If the condition may be caused or apparently caused by any of multiple genes, then the specificity is low.
