Scope and Usage
---------------
A contribution describes the part played by a particular agent in the creation, modification, assessment, or descruction of an artifact. The scope of a given 'contribution' instance is constrained to include only the actions of a particular agent in contributing to a particular artifact. Contribution instances are used to organize information about when, where, how (e.g. what roles were played), and on whose behalf these actions were performed.
