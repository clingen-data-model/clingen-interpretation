Scope and Usage
---------------

An IdentifierSystem is a curated system of identifiers.  Identifiers from such a system can be included in ValueSets, with the IdentifierSystem entity mapping from the CURIE prefix for an identifier to the location of the system.   

Users of the interpretation model will not need to use IdentifierSystem in writing or parsing interpretation messages; rather it is an internal entity used only in the definition of our ValueSets.
