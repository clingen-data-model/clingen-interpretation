Scope and Usage
---------------

Although external naming systems provide labels for entities such as diseases, some users will require the ability to relabel entities with names that have local or historical importance.  A UserLabel  contains this user-defined label, as well as a Contribution describing the provenance of the label, and comments about the need for the label.
