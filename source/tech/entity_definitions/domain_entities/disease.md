Scope and Usage
---------------

The values of Disease correspond to diseases as defined in one of several IdentifierSystems including MeSH, Disease Ontology, OMIM, and MONDO.

This DomainEntity wraps values from a ValueSet, see the [discussion](../../../user/discussion/domain_entity.html) for more on this topic.  In particular this entity is not fully instantiated in the interpretation model, but is defined in terms of the identifiers produced by external IdentifierSystems.
