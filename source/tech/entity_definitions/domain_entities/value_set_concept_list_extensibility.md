Scope and Usage
---------------

The ValueSetConceptListExtensibility should not be needed to write or parse interpretation messages.  Instead, it is an annotation on ValueSets that defines whether a particular value set may be extended by users for their own purposes or whether the value set is considered closed, and only values from the set are valid.
