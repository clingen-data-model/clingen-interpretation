Scope and Usage
---------------

The values of Phenotype correspond to phenotypes as defined in IdentifierSystems such as the Human Phenotype Ontology.  When used in this setting, phenotypes are understood to be a more granular description than a disease, and are often identified with specific disease symptoms.

This DomainEntity wraps values from a ValueSet, see the [discussion](../../../user/discussion/domain_entity.html) for more on this topic.  In particular this entity is not fully instantiated in the interpretation model, but is defined in terms of the identifiers produced by external IdentifierSystems.
