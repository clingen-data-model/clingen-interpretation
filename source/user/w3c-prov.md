[W3C-Prov](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/) is a specification for defining the provenance of objects. That is, given an object, this framework provides a standard way to say
* who generated (created) the object
* when they generated it
* what type of activity was used to generate it
* which other objects were used in the generation

W3C-Prov is composed of three types: Entity, Activity, and Agent.  Entities are simply the things in the model.  In the interpretation model, the entities are
* An interpretation (e.g. An allele is pathogenic for a given condition)
* An Assessed Criteria (e.g. PP2 for a given allele and condition provides supporting evidence of pathogenicity)
* Evidence Statements (e.g. a population frequency of an allele, segregation data, prevalence of a condition)
* Evidence Sources (e.g., Publications, database records)
Entities have provenance; each was generated by a particular Activity.

Activities are an action that lasted for a particular time range, which used some entities to generate other entities.  In the interpretation model, the activities correspond to those listed above:
* Evidence capture, which uses Evidence Sources to generate Evidence Statements
* Criteria Assessment, which uses Evidence Statements to generate AssessedCriteria
* GenerateInterpretation which uses AssessedCriteria to generate Interpretations

Agents are associated with Activities and entities, and answer the question of who performed the activity.  Agents may be individuals, but may also be groups, such as an expert panel, or a software agent, such as one that automatically loads evidence from a source.
