Core entities are the basic high-level entities used to define the model.  Every instance of the interpretation model has a VariantInterpretation as its root.  This VariantInterpretation is supported, via EvidenceLines, with CriterionAssessments. These CriterionAssessments are themselves supported by evidential Statements.
