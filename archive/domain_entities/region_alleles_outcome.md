Scope and Usage
---------------

The RegionAlleleOutcome DomainEntity contains only a single value, denoting that an allele overlaps a region.   A statement that an allele does not overlap the region is created by composing this DomainEntity with a qualifier at the Statement level.


This DomainEntity wraps values from a ValueSet, see the [discussion](../../../user/discussion/domain_entity.html) for more on this topic.
