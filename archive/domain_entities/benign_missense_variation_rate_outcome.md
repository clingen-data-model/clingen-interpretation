Scope and Usage
---------------

The values of BenignMissenseVariationRateOutcome are either High or Low.  A high rate means that this particular gene supports many missense variants that do not lead to a given genetic condition.  A low rate means that there are few such benign missense variants.   A specific cutoff value is not given or implied.

This DomainEntity wraps values from a ValueSet, see the [discussion](../../../user/discussion/domain_entity.html) for more on this topic.
