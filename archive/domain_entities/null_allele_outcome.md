Scope and Usage
---------------

The NullAlleleOutcome DomainEntity contains only a single value, denoting that an allele causes a loss of function.   A statement that an allele is not a null allele is created by composing this DomainEntity with a qualifier at the Statement level.

This DomainEntity wraps values from a ValueSet, see the [discussion](../../../user/discussion/domain_entity.html) for more on this topic.
