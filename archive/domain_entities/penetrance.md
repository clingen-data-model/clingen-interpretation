Scope and Usage
---------------

The values of Penetrance correspond to qualitative estimates of disease penetrance: the likelihood of being affected by a condition given the presence of a particular pathogenic allele or damaged gene.  No fixed cutoff values are used to distinguish low penetrance from high, but complete is reserved for situations in which penetrance is expected to be 100%.

This DomainEntity wraps values from a ValueSet, see the [discussion](../../../user/discussion/domain_entity.html) for more on this topic.
