Scope and Usage
---------------

The values of InconsistentSegregationObserved denote whether any inconsistent segregations, in which a segregation of allele and phenotype are inconsistent with allele pathogenicity, are observed in a pedigree.

This DomainEntity wraps values from a ValueSet, see the [discussion](../../../user/discussion/domain_entity.html) for more on this topic.
