Scope and Usage
---------------

For diploid segments of a genome, an allele in an individual may occur on one or two copies of a chromosome.  This zygosity is captured in the values of AllelicState.  In addition, AllelicState captures more complicated situations including mitochondrial, somatic, and non-diploid chromosomal segments.

This DomainEntity wraps values from a ValueSet, see the [discussion](../../../user/discussion/domain_entity.html) for more on this topic.
