Scope and Usage
---------------

The values of MolecularConsequence denote the downstream effects of an allele on transcriptional or translational entities produced by a gene.  When an allele is not located in a translated region, the MolecularConsequence is defined by the type of region in which it lies, such as intron or UTR.

This DomainEntity wraps values from a ValueSet, see the [discussion](../../../user/discussion/domain_entity.html) for more on this topic.
