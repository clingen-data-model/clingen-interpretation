Scope and Usage
---------------

The values of EvidenceLineStrength correspond to the differing strengths with which satisfied assessment criteria can support interpretations, as well as the direction of that support.  This set of values is defined by the ACMG Variant Pathogenicity Guidelines.

This DomainEntity wraps values from a ValueSet, see the [discussion](../../../user/discussion/domain_entity.html) for more on this topic.
