However, this does not provide supporting evidence for CA112 being benign because the combination of a COL2A1 and COMP variant are known to produce a more severe phenotype, Pseudoachondroplastic spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia syndrome, which is the phenotype of the proband.  Because the combination of alleles may produce a qualitatively different phenotype, the bone dysplasia caused by the COMP variant does not provide evidence that the COL2A1 variant is benign for any bone dysplasias in general.\n",
