    "explanation": "Variants in COL2A1 are associated with dominant spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (a primary bone dysplasia). CA112 was identified in a  proband with CA113, which is pathogenic for another primary bone dysplasia, dominant Pseudoachondroplasia. However, this does not provide supporting evidence for CA112 being benign because the combination of a COL2A1 and COMP variant are known to produce a more severe phenotype, Pseudoachondroplastic spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia syndrome, which is the phenotype of the proband.  Because the combination of alleles may produce a qualitatively different phenotype, the bone dysplasia caused by the COMP variant does not provide evidence that the COL2A1 variant is benign for any bone dysplasias in general.\n",

    "explanation": "This variant is a silent variant that does not result in an amino acid change. It is not very conserved and splicing tools suggest no change. However, BP7 does not apply because the variant is located in the first base of exon 4 of RAF1, which is part of the 3’ splice region of the exon. For that reason, we can’t fully trust computational tools. Functional assays would have to confirm that this variant truly does not alter splicing.",
