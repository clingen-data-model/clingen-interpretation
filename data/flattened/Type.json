    "comments": "Evidence lines are organizational nodes in SEPIO used to group all pieces of information that was interpreted as evidence contributing to a single, independent argument relevant to the validity of a proposition. In a sense, they can be viewed as representing the relationship between a set of one or more such 'evidence items' and a proposition, where the evidence items are interpreted together to make an independently meaningful argument relevant to the proposition's validity. In SEPIO, we define them as representing the argument itself, as this is the simplest and most pragmatic way to explain this concept to users. But we acknowledge that the precise ontological nature of an 'argument', and therefore an 'evidence line', in the context of the BFO remains ambiguous.\n\nAn evidence line is created through the interpretation of one or more pieces of information that collectively can support a meaningful argument for or against a proposition. To qualify as an Evidence Line, this argument must be independently significant as evidence - i.e. it must be capable of affecting the probability of accepting the target proposition as true. This does not mean, however, that it is independently sufficient to establish belief in the proposition, as additional evidence lines may be required to ultimately accept the proposition as true. For example, in the ACMG framework for variant interpretations establishes \"absence in population databases\" as a type of evidence line that can argue for the pathogenicty of a particular variant. But this argument alone is not considered sufficient to establish a variant's pathogencity, as the other types of evidence are additionally required to establish the truth of this Proposition (e.g. a line of evidence demonstrating the variant to have a deleterious effect on protein function, or showing it to segregate with disease features in a family tree)."
