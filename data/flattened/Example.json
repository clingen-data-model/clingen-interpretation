A common functional assay for transporters is to measure channel function in vitro. It is also common to measure cellular localization of the transporter, as it will not function properly if it’s mislocalized. When this variant was expressed as a GFP-tagged construct in HEK 293 cells and imaged, it localized to the apical membrane as wild type protein does. Additionally, iodide efflux, a speculated function of the channel, was unchanged in cells expressing the channel variant. The PMID for this paper is  1193231."
