    "interpretationText": "The Trp2490_Leu2496del variant in DNAH5 leads to an in-frame deletion of 7 amino acids. This variant has been reported together with a second DNAH5 variant (Met2083Ile) in one individual with PCD and situs inversus (Berg 2011). In addition, this variant has been identified in trans configuration with a disease-causing variant in one affected proband (LMM unpublished data). Data from large population studies is insufficient to determine whether this variant is present in the general population. In summary, this variant is likely pathogenic, though additional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance.",
