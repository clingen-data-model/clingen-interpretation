Scope and Usage
---------------

The Family identifies a group of related individuals.  The purpose of this grouping is to help describe groups of people that may share alleles by descent. 

The Family type does not contain elements for constructing pedigrees or other detailed representations of the Family or specific familial relationships.  Instead, it is simply an identifier so that multiple statements can be made about the same group of related individuals.
